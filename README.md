## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

Using the README generator, users can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'ExampleREADME.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.
